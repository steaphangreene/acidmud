<p>Note that AcidMUD is just a system, it does not have any content, so 
it has been configured to load and roughly translate some

content instead.  I make no claim to ownership or authorship of any of 
that content.  I am using it with permission, as far as I know.  If 
someone knows that is not the case, please let me know right away.</p>
